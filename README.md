## Diningin Time Tracker
Scrapes data from the #lunch-delivery slack channel to gather food delivery times for displaying via the [diningin enhancements](https://github.com/steenburgh/diningin-enhancements) chrome extension

### Development
Before the code will run, you'll need to make a Credentials.py which will contain a slack auth token. Instructions are included in `Sample_Credentials.py`
